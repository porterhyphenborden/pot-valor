## Sumary

### Motivation

To consolidate meal planning for the modern at-home cook by creating a space where a user can find  cocktail recipes, food recipes, and suggested wine pairings, all in one search.

### Concept

"After a long day of work, cooking can feel like drudgery. But cooking should be fun â€” a celebration of creativity and culture! "Pot-valiant" is an old British term for the feeling of brazenness you get after a couple drinks. So open a bottle of something tasty and get a little bold in the kitchen! Search for recipes wth suggested wine pairings, and also find something to make your time in the kitchen a little more festive."

### Description

Pot-Valor allows the user to pull recipes from the CocktailDB API and Spoonacular API simultaneously.  The user can search cocktail recipes by ingredient, and food recipes by multiple parameters, including ingredients, cuisine, diet, etc.  Results are display for cocktail recipes, food recipes, and wine pairings, if found.
